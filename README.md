# Maze tool
**V1.0**
* Initial release
* Click on the squares to indicate where the passageways are. Click on them again to remove.
* Due to the spawn portal not neccesarily being centered on the bottom face of pyramid, you can shift the entire maze left and right. Maze passageways that are shifted beyond the grid are deleted!!!
